We are a private, not-for-profit, foster-based dog rescue. We will help any dog in need that we can, regardless of breed, age, medical condition or place of birth. Our mission is to find homes for dogs that find themselves homeless, either through abuse, neglect, abandonment, or being born in a puppy mill. All of our dogs are currently living in loving foster homes across Ontario.
