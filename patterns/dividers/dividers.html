    <h2 class="yotta push-2">How We Do It</h2>
    <p class="pform">Applications for adoption can be submitted directly through our website. Every potential adopter must go through our 5-step adoption process. If you are a previous LOYAL adopter please contact us first so that we can determine whether all 5 steps will need to be completed again.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="milli max-length-no-center text-left gutter-2 line-separator pad-t-2">
    <h2 class="mega push-1-2">Step 1: Submit an Application</h2>
    <p class="pform push-2">Visit our website often as we post new, available dogs on a daily basis. If we have a rescued dog that is available and that you are interested in adopting, please fill out an online adoption application online. Alternatively, you are welcome to send us an e-mail to confirm that that dog is available for adoption. If the words "adoption pending" or "pending" are next to their name, we are no longer accepting applications. Our website updates every few days, so even if these words are not next to the dogs name, they may have a pending adoption in play. Some dogs (like puppies and other young dogs) are very popular, and because we are 100% volunteer run we are only able to process so many application at a time.</p>

    <h2 class="mega push-1-2">Step 2: Phone Interview</h2>
    <p class="pform push-2">Once your application is received and reviewed, and assuming all is well and that dog is available for adoption and a "match", a LOYAL representative will contact you via e-mail to set up a time to discuss your application over the phone, prior to which your veterinarian will be contacted, and following which your personal references will be contacted. During the phone screen our volunteer will chat with you about LOYAL Rescue, ask you some questions about your daily routine, your expectations about the dog you are hoping to adopt, your pet history, and will answer any questions that you have.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="milli max-length-no-center text-left gutter-2 line-separator pad-t-2">
    <h2 class="mega push-1-2">Step 3: Home Visit</h2>
    <p class="pform push-2">Assuming all goes well during your phone interview, our Adoption Committee will review your file and will have a chat with the foster family to determine that you are still a fit for your chosen dog. If all is approved, then you will move it on to the next stage - the home visit. At this stage, a LOYAL representative will contact you to set up a time that is convenient to come to your home, and will review the application again with you and your family in person. This allows us to get an idea of your home, family dynamic, schedule and a general feel for your suitability for your rescued dog of choice. All family members must be present at the time of the visit.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="milli max-length-no-center text-left gutter-2 line-separator pad-t-2">
    <h2 class="mega push-1-2">Step 4: Approval</h2>
    <p class="pform push-2">All reports are then reviewed by LOYAL's Adoption Committee, and a decision is made whether or not your home is the best possible 'forever home' for the rescued dog(s). You will be contacted via e-mail by our Board of Directors with the final decision.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="milli max-length-no-center text-left gutter-2 line-separator pad-t-2">
    <h2 class="mega push-1-2">Step 5: Adoption</h2>
    <p class="pform push-2">If approved, you are then welcome to set up a time for a meet-and-greet with the dog and its foster family, and if you choose to proceed with the adoption then an adoption contract is to be completed, along with the pre-determined adoption donation and, finally, pick-up of the dog by its new forever home.</p>
